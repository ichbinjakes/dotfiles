### Notes:

A **terminal emulator**, or terminal application, is a computer program that emulates a video terminal within some other display architecture.

A **terminal multiplexer** is a software application that can be used to multiplex several separate pseudoterminal-based login sessions inside a single terminal display, terminal emulator window, PC/workstation system console, or remote login session, or to detach and reattach sessions from a terminal. It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating programs from the session of the Unix shell that started the program, particularly so a remote process continues running even when the user is disconnected. 

A **shell prompt** is what you see when you type a command. It can show a lot of useful tips, saving your time and making the user experience smooth and pleasant. It combines everything you may need for convenient work, without unnecessary complications, like a real spaceship.
